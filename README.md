# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import Necessary Libraries and Load Data
2. Split Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
3. Train the Model Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
4. Make Predictions and Evaluate Accuracy
5. Generate Confusion Matrix
